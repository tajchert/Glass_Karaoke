Glass Karaoke
=========

It is a slight modification of a stopwatch (from the samples), to make it show lyrics for karaoke.
You can add more songs in InitSongs class with their lyrics and time that they should appear on a screen.

If you want to try it, test lyrics are for that video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4H8zXwVbVE
